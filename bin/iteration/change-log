quick fix 15
- idle detection bug fixed
- more message delay mechanism bugs fixed (will it ever end?)

quick fix 13, 14
- restored back nested agents (needs other solution)

quick fix 12
- many bugfixes in message delays feature
- some documentation added

- some statistics made faster

quick fix 11
- nested agents inhencement
- fixed null pointer exception in GUI

quick fix 6:
- Agent.getProblem() is now public (good for tool makers)

quick fix 5:
- getAgents added to the execution (useful for module creators)

quick fix 4:

  + send(...).toNeighbores(Problem) got deprecated use send(...).toNeighbores() instaed
  + panicIf(predicate, message) in agent class
