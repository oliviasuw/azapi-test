                        Distributed constraint reasoning is a framework for describing distributed combinatorial problems of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Problems are defined in terms of constraints between variables owned by agents. The agents search cooperatively for a global optimal solution by assigning values to their variables

                        Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a group of interrelated web development methods used on the client-side to create interactive web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data is usually retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not needed (JSON is often used instead), and the requests need not be asynchronous.
